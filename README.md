# SOLSIM Global

SOLSIM Global is a pet project designed to replicate a Figma design into an interactive web application. This project demonstrates precise implementation of UI/UX elements, responsiveness, and interactivity using modern web development tools.

## Features

- Responsive design with pixel-perfect alignment.
- Interactive plan selection with dynamic price calculation in multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Modern UI components built with React and TailwindCSS.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and ensuring responsiveness.
- **DaisyUI**: For additional TailwindCSS components.
- **React-Select**: For implementing the currency selector.
- **FontAwesome**: For intuitive icons.
